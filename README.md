# Advent of Code Solutions (Python)

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in Python. This repository is organized to make it easy to navigate through different years and their respective challenges.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: This directory contains input files for the challenges. They are organized by year.
- `/year`: Each year has its own folder (e.g.,, `/2023`). Inside year's folder, you'll find the Python scripts for each day's challenge.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/abdoufermat5/Advent-Of-Code.git`
2. Navigate to the year of interest: `cd ./[Year]` (e.g., `cd ./2023`)
3. Explore the script for the day you're interested in: `day1.py` for example
